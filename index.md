## Summary

Determined quick learner wtih interest in enterprise networking, security, system administration, open-source software and DevOps culture. I strongly believe in automating everything that is repeatable and that infrastructure should be treated as code which brings best practices from software development to operations. I am also building a small personal blog site based on these principles at [blog.luknagy.com](https://blog.luknagy.com), which code is open-sourced on my GitHub profile.
